# Music-Player
I created a full-featured Music Player system with buttons for play, pause, advance, and back Using JavaScript Code.
It shows the music names and rotating thumbnails of the song in the music player and many more functionalities.
A music player is a tool that is used to play audio music in formats like MP3, WAV, etc. When listening to songs, a music player is useful. We regularly listen to music on a music player. Spotify, Google Music, and other popular music streaming services are some examples of music players.
